TLDR at the bottom

Welcome weary internet traveler!

Grab a seat and sit back and relax. As I tell you a tale of how this barren Github became to be. I was a young and foolish child that have discovered technology for the first time. I was determined to learn and use everything even if I was never going to use it again. After learning and earning certification in hardware and networking. I set my sight on more difficult topics such as programming, data analysis, and sysadmin. But my thirst for knowledge grew insatiable and I wanted to learn more! As I keep finding newer technology and topic to learn, a terrible weakness begins to lurk nearby..I noticed the foundation below me is starting to shake. But wait... it's now beginning to crack! In my attempt to learn about self-hosting my own services such as Gitea in replace of Github. I forgot the golden rule when it comes to storage/backups. The 3-2-1 Backup Rule... I didn't realize the importance of that rule till this fateful day. An electrical/fire issue happened near my servers and I lost everything. If only I kept a copy at another location. This would have never happened. But unfortunately for me, I lost all my data. This includes all my previous repositories/projects that I made in Gitea and all other related files on my servers. Now I'm sitting here with you and wondering, what's next?

TLDR
I didn't follow the 3-2-1 backup rule. I lost the servers where I hosted all my previous projects and repositories. This GitHub profile is currently empty and I'm in the process of rebuilding all that I lost.
